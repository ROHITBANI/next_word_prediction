You've certainly heard about the GPT language models that are used by many AI tools such as ChatGPT. 
What these models do, in simple terms, they try to accurately predict what the most logical next word
would be given an input. In this project, I implemented a similar model, of course, much less advanced. 
Selected a set of training data with a lot of real-life text (e.g. a book) and used it to train a neural network which,
given input with a couple of words, returns the list of the most probable words that would make for a logical continuation.
